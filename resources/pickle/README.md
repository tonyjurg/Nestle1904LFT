# Pickle files

Zipped pickle files to be used as input to create TextFabric files.
Note these files are NOT SORTED on word order in the corpus. The sorting will be done by the Text-Fabric creation script.

More information with regards to the [pickle file format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).

Note: The name of the containing directory refers to the date of the source data (YYYMMDD), not the creation date of the pickle files.
