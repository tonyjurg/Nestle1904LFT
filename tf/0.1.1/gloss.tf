2174	The
elder
To [the] elect
lady
and
the
children
of her
whom
love
in
truth
I
and
not
I
only
but
also
all
those
having known
the
truth
because of
the
truth
-
abiding
in
us
and
with
us
that will be
to
the
age
Will be
with
us
grace
mercy
[and] peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
from
Jesus
Christ
the
Son
of the
Father
in
truth
and
love
I rejoiced
exceedingly
that
I have found
[some] of
the
children
of you
walking
in
truth
just as
commandment
we received
from
the
Father
And
lady
now
I implore
you
I am writing
to you
not
as
a commandment
new
but
that which
we have had
from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
And
this
is
-
love
that
we should walk
according to
the
commandments
of Him
This
the
commandment
is
just as
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
so that
in
it
you should walk
For
have entered
into
the
world
many
deceivers
those
not
confessing
Jesus
Christ
coming
in
flesh
This
is
the
deceiver
and
the
antichrist
Watch
yourselves
so that
not
you should lose
what things
we have worked for
but
a reward
full
you may receive
Anyone
-
going on ahead
and
not
abiding
in
the
teaching
-
of Christ
God
not
has
The [one]
abiding
in
the
teaching
this [one]
both
the
Father
and
the
Son
has
If
anyone
comes
to
you
and
this
-
teaching
not
does bring
not
receive
him
into
[the] house
and
to rejoice
him
not
tell
for
the [one]
telling
him
to rejoice
partakes
in the
works
of him
-
evil
having
Many things
to you
to write
not
I purposed
with
paper
and
ink
but
I hope
to come
to
you
and
mouth
to
mouth
to speak
so that
the
joy
of us
having been completed
may be
Greet
you
the
children
of the
sister
of you
-
elect
The
elder
To Gaius
the
beloved
whom
I
love
in
truth
Beloved
concerning
all things
I pray
you
to prosper
and
to be in good health
just as
prospers
your
-
soul
for
I rejoiced
exceedingly
coming
of [the] brothers
and
bearing witness
of your
-
truth
just as
you
in
truth
are walking
Greater
joy
than these things
not
I have
that
I should hear of
-
my
children
in
the
truth
walking
Beloved
faithfully
you are doing
if
whatever
you might have done
toward
the
brothers
and
they are
strangers
who
testified
of your
-
love
before
[the] church
whom
well
you will do
having set forward
worthily
-
of God
for
On behalf
of the
name
they went forth
nothing
accepting
from
the
Gentiles
therefore
We
ought
to receive
-
such [men]
so that
fellow workers
we may be
in the
truth
I have written
something
to the
church
but
the [one]
loving to be first
among them
Diotrephes
not
welcomes
us
Because of
this
if
I might come
I will bring to remembrance
of him
the
works
which
he is doing
with words
evil
prating against
us
and
not
being satisfied
with
these
neither
himself
he receives
the
brothers
and
those
purposing
he forbids
and
from
the
church
he casts [them] out
Beloved
not
do imitate
what [is]
evil
but
what [is]
good
The [one]
doing good
of
-
God
is
the [one]
doing evil
not
has seen
-
God
To Demetrius
witness has been given
by
all
and
by
itself
the
truth
also
and
we
bear witness
and
you know
that
the
testimony
of us
true
is
I had
Many things
to write
to you
but
not
I desire
with
ink
and
pen
to you
to write
however
I hope
soon
you
to see
and
mouth
to
mouth
we will speak
Peace
to you
Greet
you

friends
