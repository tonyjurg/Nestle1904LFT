As these
concerning

What
went you out
into
the
wilderness
to see
A reed

began

Jesus
to speak
to the
crowds
But
those

wearing
in

of kings
what
did you go out
to see
A man

Behold

more excellent
than a prophet
what
did you go out
a prophet
to see
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
At
through
the
grainfields
-
and
the disciples
of Him
were hungry
and
they began
that
to pluck [the]
heads of grain
and
to eat
-
time
went
-
Jesus
on the
Sabbaths
And
saying
Is
it lawful
on the
Sabbaths
to heal
so that
they might accuse
Him
behold
a man
a hand
having
withered
And
they asked
Him
-
who
will have
sheep
one
and
if
falls
it
on the
Sabbaths
And
into
a pit
not
will he take hold of
it
and
will raise [it] up
He said
to them
What
will there be
among
you
man
How much
good
to do
therefore
is more valuable
a man
than a sheep
Therefore
it is lawful
on the
Sabbaths
Then
he stretched [it] out
and
it was restored
sound
as
the
other
He says
to
[the] man
Stretch out
your
-
hand
And
Having gone out
Him
they might destroy
now
the
Pharisees
a counsel
held
against
Him
how
-
great
and
He healed
them
all
And
Jesus
having known
withdrew
from there
And
followed
Him
and
He warned
them
that
not
known
Him
they should make
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Behold
whom
has found delight
the
soul
of Me
I will put
the
Spirit
of Me
upon
the
Him
and
justice
to the
Gentiles
He will proclaim
servant
of Me

I have chosen

of Me

He leads
to
victory

bruised
not
He will break
and
a wick
smoldering
not
He will quench
And
in the

of Him
[the] Gentiles
will hope
Then
him

to speak

to see

to Him

and
He healed

of Jonah

of Jonah
of Nineveh
and
behold
greater
than Jonah
here
will stand up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
The queen
this
and
will condemn
it
for
she came
from
the
ends
of the
of [the] south
earth
to hear
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
greater
than Solomon
here
will rise up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
When
it passes
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
none
finds [it]
now
the
unclean
spirit
is gone out
from
the
man
Then
And
having come
it finds [it]
being unoccupied
and
swept
and
put in order
it says
To
the

of me
I will return
from where
I came out
Then
more evil
than itself

having entered in
they dwell
there

worse

they have seen
the
Son
I say

of Man
coming
in
the

of Him
to you
-
there are
some
of those

standing
And
The

Today

A generation

to it

sign
of Jonah
And
having left
them
evil
He went away
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks

a sign

And
to take
having come
the
disciples
to
the
other side
they forgot
bread
-
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
And
Jesus
said
to them
Watch
and
beware

And
they were reasoning
among
themselves
saying
Because
bread

Having known [this]
O [you] of little faith
because
bread
not
you took
however
-
Jesus
said
Why
reason you
among
yourselves
Not yet
and
how many

nor

the
five
loaves

Peter
And
scribes
say
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
asked
Him
the
disciples
saying
Why
then
the
-
all things
And
answering
He said
Elijah
indeed
comes
and
will restore
I say
they knew
him
but
did
to
him
whatever
they desired
Thus
also
however
the
Son
-
of Man
is about
to suffer
from
them
to you
that
Elijah
already
is come
and
not
Then
He spoke
to them
understood
the
disciples
that
concerning
John
the
Baptist
And
Him
they having come
to
the
crowd
came
to Him
a man
kneeling down to

and
miserably
suffers
often
for
he falls
into
the
fire
and
saying
often
into
the
water
Lord
have mercy on
my

son
for
he is epileptic
And
him
to heal
I brought
him
to the
disciples
of You
and
not

Answering
perverted
how long
when
with
you
will I be
How long
when
will I bear with

Jesus
said
O
generation
unbelieving
and
And
the
demon
and
was healed
the
boy
from
the
hour
that
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
and
went out
from
him
Then
Because of
why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
having come
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
in
private
they said
And
like
the
sun
-
and
the clothes
of Him
became
white
as
He was transfigured
the
light
before
them
and
shone
the
face
of Him
-
for
I say
to you
If
you have
faith
as
a seed
of mustard
you will say
And
to the
mountain
to this
Move
from here
to there
and
it will move
And
nothing
He said
will be impossible
for you
to them
Because of
the
little faith
of you
Truly
Were abiding
Jesus
Is about
the
Son
-
of Man
to be betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men
now
they
in
-
Galilee
said
to them
-
and
they were grieved
deeply
they will kill
Him
and
on the
third
day
He will be raised up
And
Having come
collecting
-
to Peter
and
said
The
Teacher
of you
not
does he pay
now
didrachmas
they
to
Capernaum
came
those
the
didrachmas
He says
-
Jesus
saying
What
you
do think
Simon
The
kings
of the
Yes
earth
from
whom
do they receive
custom
or
tribute
From
the
sons
And
of them
or
from

strangers
he having entered
into
the
house
anticipated
him
He having said
Then
free
are
the
sons
now
From
the
strangers
said
to him
-
Jesus
That
a hook
and
the
having come up
first
fish
take
and
having opened
the
however
mouth
of it
you will find
a four-drachma coin
That
having taken
give
to them
for
Me
not
and
yourself
we might offend
them
having gone
to
sea
cast
And
Him
behold
appeared
to them
Moses
and
Elijah
talking
with
Answering
it is
for us
here
to be
If
You wish
I will make
here
three
tabernacles
now
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
-
Peter
said
-
to Jesus
Lord
good
While yet
behold
a voice
out of
the
cloud
saying
This
is
the
Son
he
of Me
the
beloved
in
whom
I am well pleased
Listen
to Him
was speaking
behold
a cloud
bright
overshadowed
them
and
And
were terrified
greatly
having heard [it]
the
disciples
fell
upon
face
of them
and
And
and
not
be afraid
having come to [them]
-
Jesus
and
having touched
them
He said
Rise up
Having lifted up
Himself
Jesus
alone
and
the
eyes
of them
no one
they saw
if
not
And
Jesus
saying
To no one
tell
the
vision
until
that
the
Son
[as] were descending
-
of Man
out from
[the] dead
is risen
they
from
the
mountain
instructed
them
-
In
saying
Who
then
[the] greatest
is
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
that
-
hour
came
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
See [that]
to you
that
the
angels
of them
in
[the] heavens
continually
always
behold
not
the
face
of the
Father
of me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
you despise
one
of the
little ones
of these
I say
for
What
and
has gone astray
one
of
them
not
will he leave
the
ninety
nine
you
on
the
mountains
and
having gone
seek
the [one]
going astray
do think
If
there should be
to any
man
a hundred
sheep
And
he rejoices
over
it
more
than
over
the
ninety
nine
-
if
not
having gone astray
he should
find
it
truly
I say
to you
that
Thus
in
[the] heavens
that
should perish
one
of the
little ones
of these
not
it is
[the] will
of
the
Father
of you
who [is]
If
between
you
and
him
alone
If
you
he will hear
you have gained
the
now
brother
of you
sins
the
brother
of you
go
reprove
him
If
or
two
that
upon
[the] testimony
of two
witnesses
or
of three
may be strengthened
however
every
word
not
he will hear
take
with
you
more
one
If
also
to the
church
he fails to listen
let him be
to you
as
the
pagan
and
now
the
tax collector
he fails to listen
to them
tell [it]
to the
church
If
now
Truly
shall have been
bound
in
heaven
and
how many
if
you shall loose
on
the
I say
earth
shall have been
loosed
in
heaven
to you
how many
if
you shall bind
on
the
earth
Again
you
on
the
earth
concerning
any
matter
that
if
they shall ask
truly
it will be done
for them
by
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
I say
to you
that
if
two
might agree
of
And
having called to [Him]
a child
He set
it
in
midst
of them
Where
My
name
there
am I
in
[the] midst
of them
for
are
two
or
three
gathered together
unto
-
Then
against
me
the
brother
of me
and
I will forgive
him
Up to
seven times
having come
-
Peter
said
to Him
Lord
how often
will sin
Says
but
up to
seventy times
seven
to him
-
Jesus
Not
I say
to you
up to
seven times
Because of
who
desired
to settle
accounts
with
the
servants
of him
this
has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a king
Having begun
talents
then
he
to settle
was brought
one
to him
a debtor
of ten thousand
Nothing
to be sold
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
all
as many as
having
he had
and
payment to be made
now
he
to pay
commanded
him
the
master
Having fallen down
me
and
all
I will pay
to you
therefore
the
servant
was bowing on his knees
to him
saying
Have patience
with
Having been moved with compassion
and
the
debt
forgave
him
now
the
master
of the
servant
that
released
him
Having gone out
of him
who
was owing
him
a hundred
denarii
and
having seized
him
he was throttling [him]
however
saying
Pay
if
any
you owe
the
servant
same
found
one
the
fellow servants
Having fallen down
with
me
and
I will pay
you
therefore
the
fellow servant
of him
was begging
him
saying
Have patience
and
become
as
the
little children
no
not
shall you enter
into
the
kingdom
said
of the
heavens
Truly
I say
to you
if
not
you turn
and
-
prison
until
he should pay
that which
was owing
But
not
he was willing
rather
having gone
he cast
him
into
Having seen
and
having gone
narrated
to
master
of themselves
all
that
having taken place
therefore
the
fellow servants
of him
the things
having taken place
they were grieved
deeply
Then
evil
all
the
debt
that
I forgave
you
because
you begged
me
having called to
him
the
master
of him
says
to him
Servant
Not
also I
you
had pitied
did it behoove
also
you
to have pitied
the
fellow servant
of you
as
And
until
that
he should pay
all
-
being owed
to him
having been angry
the
master
of him
delivered
him
to the
jailers
Thus
if
not
you forgive
each
the
brother
of him
from
the
heart
also
of you
the
Father
of Me
-
Heavenly
will do
to you
Whoever
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
therefore
will humble
himself
as
the
little child
this
he
And
name
of Me
Me
receives
whoever
if
shall receive
one
little child
such
in
the
Whoever
believing
in
Me
it is better
for him
that
should be hung
a millstone
heavy
around
then
the
neck
of him
and
he be sunk
in
the
depth
of the
sea
-
shall cause to stumble
one
of the
little ones
of these
-
Woe
the
stumbling blocks
but
woe
to the
man
by
whom
the
offense
to the
comes
world
because of
the
causes of sin
Necessary [are]
for
to come
If
causes to sin
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
better
for you
now
it is
to enter
into
-
life
crippled
or
lame
than
two
the
hands
or
two
feet
having
to be cast
into
the
fire
-
hand
eternal
of you
or
the
foot
of you
And
and
cast [it]
from
you
better
for you
it is
one-eyed
into

if
life
to enter
than
two
eyes
having
to be cast
into
the
hell
the
of the
fire
eye
of you
causes to sin
you
gouge out
it
And
He withdrew
from
-
Galilee
and
came
to
the
region
-
it came to pass
of Judea
beyond
the
Jordan
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
words
these
Say
of the
man
with
the
wife
not
it is better
to marry
to Him
the
disciples
If
this
is
the
case
-
this
but only [those]
to whom
it has been given
And
He said
to them
Not
all
receive
the
word
There are
and
there are
eunuchs
who
were made eunuchs
by
-
men
and
there are
for
eunuchs
who
made eunuchs of
themselves
for the sake of
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
The [one]
eunuchs
being able
to receive [it]
let him receive [it]
who
from [the]
womb
of [their] mother
were born
thus
Then
and
He might pray
-
however
the disciples
rebuked
them
were brought
to Him
little children
that
the
hands
He might lay
on them
-
do forbid
them
to come
to
Me
of the
for
such kind
is
the
And
kingdom
of the
heavens
Jesus
said
Permit
the
little children
and
not
And
having laid
the
hands
upon them
He departed
from there
And
shall I do
that
I might have
life
eternal
behold
one
having come
to Him
said
Teacher
what
good [thing]
-
good
Only One
is
-
good
If
however
you desire
into
-
And
life
to enter
keep
the
commandments
He said
to him
Why
Me
ask you
about
what is
He says
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
to him
Which
-
And
Jesus
said
-
Not
you shall honor
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
the
father
and
the
mother
and
you shall love
-
And
followed
Him
crowds
great
and
He healed
them
there
Says
lack I
to him
the
young man
Things
all these
I have kept
What
yet
Was saying
sell
of you
the
possessing
and
give
poor
and
you will have
treasure
to him
in
[the] heavens
and
come
follow
Me
-
Jesus
If
you desire
perfect
to be
go
Having heard
for
having
possessions
many
now
the
young man
the
statement
he went away
grieving
he was [one]
-
to you
that
a rich man
with difficulty
will enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
Jesus
said
to the
disciples
of Him
Truly
I say
Again
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
of
God
now
I say
to you
easier for
[it] is
a camel
through [the]
eye
Having heard
is able
to be saved
now
the
disciples
were astonished
exceedingly
saying
Who
then
Having looked on [them]
impossible
is
with
however
God
all things [are]
possible
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
With
men
this
Then
all things
and
followed
You
what
then
will be
to us
answering
-
Peter
said
to Him
Behold
we
left
-
you
-
having followed
Me
in
the
regeneration
when
shall sit down
the
And
Son
-
of Man
upon
[the] throne
of glory
of Him
will sit
also
you
Jesus
on
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
-
of Israel
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
And
or
father
or
mother
or
children
or
lands
for the sake of
-
everyone
My
name
a hundredfold
will receive
and
life
eternal
will inherit
who
has left
houses
or
brothers
or
sisters
And
is it lawful
to divorce
the
a wife
to him
for
every
cause
came
to Him
Pharisees
testing
Him
and
saying
If
Many
however
will be
first
last
and
last
first
Which
from [the]
beginning
male
and
female
made
them
now
answering
He said
Not
have you read
that
the [One]
having created
and
the
mother
and
be joined with
the
wife
of him
and
will become
the
said
two
into
flesh
one
On account of
this
will leave
a man
the
father
and
so that
-
God
united together
man
not
let separate
no longer
are they
two
but
flesh
one
What
therefore
They say
and
to send away
to Him
Why
then
Moses
did command
to give
a roll
of divorce
He says
you
to divorce
the
wives
of you
from [the]
beginning
however
not
was [it]
to them
this way
-
Moses
in view of
the
hardness of heart
of you
allowed
I say
of him

for
sexual immorality
and

And
they received

Having agreed
he sent
them
into

for
a denarius
for the

Jesus
called
them
and
said
What
They say
to Him
Lord
that
might be opened

Having been moved with compassion
immediately
they received sight
and
they followed
Him
then

Jesus

And
the crowds
were saying
This
is
the
prophet
Jesus
And
those
selling
and
buying
in
the
temple
and
the
tables
entered
of the
money changers
He overturned

He says
to them
It has been written

And
and
He healed

to Me
Go

in front
of you
And
the
fig tree
having seen [it]
the

marveled
saying
How
so quickly
withered
Answering
if
you have
faith
and
not
do doubt
not

the [miracle]
of the
now

will you do
but
even if
to the

this
you should say
Be you taken away

said
to them

I say
to you
And
you will receive

to
Him

He had been accustomed
again
He was teaching

concerning

of her
should marry
another

rebuked
them

to Him
little children
that
them
He might touch

I have kept

again
answering
says
to them
Children

of God
to enter

were astonished
at
the
words
of Him

Easier

will flog
Him
And
saying to
Him
Teacher
we desire
that
whatever
if
we might ask
you
You would do
come up
for us
to Him
James
and
John
the
sons
of Zebedee
-
And
He said
to them
What
do you desire
Me
to do
for you
-
at
[Your] right hand
and
one
at
[Your] left hand
we might sit
in
the
glory
And
of You
they said
to Him
Grant
to us
that
one
of [us]
-
Are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
drink
and
the
baptism
And
which
I
am baptized
to be baptized [with]
Jesus
said
to them
Not
you know
what
you ask
-
to them
The
cup
which
I
drink
you will drink
and
the
baptism
And
which
I
am baptized
you will be baptized [with]
they said
to Him
We are able

And
Jesus
said
-
to send [her] away
And
they said
Permitted
Moses
a roll
of divorce
to write
and
-
not
is
Mine
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
but
to sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
or
at
[the] left hand
And
John
having heard [this]
the
ten
began
to be indignant
about
James
and
And
those
being accounted
to rule over
the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
those
great ones
having called near
of them
exercise authority over
them
them
-
Jesus
says
to them
You know
that
Not
desires
great
to become
among
you
will be
your
servant
thus
however
shall it be
among
you
Instead
whoever

and
of all
slave
whoever
-
desires
among
you
to become
first
will be
Even
but
to serve
and
to give
the
life
of Him
[as] a ransom
for
many
for
the
Son

of Man
not

to be served
And
and
the
disciples
of Him
and
a crowd
large

was sitting
beside
the
road
to
Jericho
And
as was going out
He
from

And
and
to say
Son
of David
Jesus
have mercy on
me
having heard
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
it is
he began
to cry out
And
more
he kept crying out
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
were rebuking
him
many
that
he should be silent
-
but
much
And
the
blind [man]
saying
to him
Take courage
Rise up
He calls
you
having stopped
-
Jesus
commanded
to be called
him
And
they call
-
He wrote
for you
the
commandment
this
But
Jesus
said
to them
Because of
the
hardness of heart
of you

Jesus
And
having cast away
the
cloak
of him
having risen up
he came
to
And
I should do

And
the blind [man]
said
to Him
Rabboni
that
I may receive sight
answering
him
-
Jesus
says
What
to you
do you desire
And
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
he began following
Him
on
the

way
Jesus
said
to him
Go

faith
of you
From
however
[the] beginning
of creation
Male
and
female
He made
them
On account of
mother

will leave
a man

father
of him
and

and
they are
two
but
one
flesh
will be
the
two
for

Therefore
no longer
What
therefore

God
has joined together

And
near
the
Mount

of Olives
He sends
two
of the
disciples
of Him
when
they drew near
to
Jerusalem

And
were listening

He began
to cast out

at
the

the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
they were seeking
And
when
evening
came
they were going forth
out of

immediately
entering
into

passing by
in the morning
they saw
the

And

Peter
says
to Him

And
answering
-
Jesus
says
to them
Have

from God
Truly

Be you taken away
and
be you cast

they began reasoning
with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
From
heaven
But
were holding
-
John
truly
that
a prophet
he was
should we say
From
men
they were afraid of
the
people

Jesus
says
to them
Neither

to Jesus
they say
Not
do we know
And

And
by
the
street
and
they untied
it
they departed
and
found
the colt
having been tied
at
the door
outside
And
untying
the
colt
some
of those
there
standing
were saying
to them
What
are you doing
-
they allowed
them
And
they spoke
to them
as
had commanded

Jesus
and
And
it
the
cloaks
of them
and
He sat
on
it
they led
the
colt
to

Jesus
and
they cast upon
And
others
then
branches
having been cut down
from
the
fields
many
the
cloaks
of them
spread
on
the
road
And
the [One]
coming
in [the]
name
of [the] Lord
those
going before
and
those
following
were crying out
Hosanna
Blessed is
And
and
he placed around [it]
a fence
and
dug
a wine vat
and
built
a tower
and
He began
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
to them
in
parables
to speak
A vineyard
a man
planted
Not even
building

has become
the
chief
corner

Scripture
this
have you read
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
from [the]
of us
Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
in
[the] eyes
And
for
that
against
them
the
parable
He had spoken
And
having left
Him
they were seeking
they went away
Him
to lay hold of
and
they feared
the
crowd
they knew
And
Herodians
that
Him
they might catch
in discourse
they send
to
Him
some
of the
Pharisees
and
of the
And
and
not
there is care
to You
about
no one

of men
but
on the basis of
[the] truth
the
way

of God

they say
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Should we pay
or
not
pay
to Him
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are

Me
do you test
Bring
Me
a denarius
that
I might see [it]
And
knowing
of them
the
hypocrisy
He said
to them
Why
-
this
and
the
inscription
-
And
they said
to Him
Caesar’s
And
they brought [it]
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
the
likeness

and
the things

of God

And
they were amazed
at
Him
And
Jesus
said
to them
The things
of Caesar
give back
to Caesar

they began questioning
Him

to him
Not

came
into

city
And
evening
having arrived
He comes
with
the

And
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
who
is eating
as were reclining
with
Me
they
and
were eating

Jesus
said
Truly
They began
I
to be grieved
and
to say
to Him
one
by
one
Surely not
They were saying
an uproar
of the
people
for
Not
during
the
feast
lest
ever
there will be
-
with
Me
in
the
bowl
And
He said
to them
[It is] one of
the
Twelve
who
is dipping
For
concerning
Him
woe
however
to the
man
that
by
whom
the

Son

of Man
is betrayed

it has been written
And
to them
and
said
Take

the
body
of Me
they were eating
of them

bread
having spoken a blessing
He broke
and
gave
And
it
all
having taken
the cup
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
and
they drank
of
And
covenant
which
is being poured out
for
many
He said
to them
This
is
the
blood
of Me
of the
Truly
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
the
day
that
when
it
I say
I drink
anew
in
the
kingdom

of God
to you
that
no more
never
not
will I drink
of
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
And
it has been written
I will strike
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
will be scattered
says
to them
-
Jesus
-
All
you will fall away
for
But

having arisen
I
will go before
you
into

And
Peter
was saying
to Him
If
even
all
will fall away
And
the
leper
having reclined
of Him
came
a woman
having
an alabaster flask
of fragrant oil
of nard
being
pure
of great price
having broken
the
alabaster flask
she poured [it] on
His

head
of Him
in
Bethany
in
the
house
of Simon
And

Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that

no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
now
also
all
of them were saying
And
emphatically
he kept saying
If
it is needful
of me
to die with
You
And
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
Sit
here
while
I shall pray
they come
to
a place
of which
the
name [is]
Gethsemane
and
And
John

He began
to be greatly awe-struck
and
deeply distressed
He takes

James
and

And

here
and

He says
to them
Very sorrowful

the
soul
of Me

And
that
if
possible
it is
might pass
from
Him
the
hour
having gone forward
a little
He fell
upon
the
ground
and
was praying
And
the
cup

from
Me
but
not

He was saying
but
what
You
Abba

within
themselves
To

And
still
and
taking your rest
It is enough
has come
the
hour

the
He comes
Son

of Man
into
the
hands
of the
sinful
the
third time
and
says
to them
Are you sleeping

a certain
of those

And

Jesus
said
to them
As

and
having left behind

he fled
And
all

And
Jesus
said
Leave alone

And
saying
Not

was questioning
Him
and
says
to Him
You

But
the
Son
of the
Blessed [One]
He was silent
and
not
did He answer
nothing
Again
the

the high priest
having torn

And
he went forth
out
into
the

But
he denied [it]
saying
Neither
I know
nor even
understand

And
standing by
-
This
[one] of
them
is
the
servant girl
having seen
him
began
again
to say
to those
Always
you desire

them
good
to do
Me
however
not
always
do you have
for
the
poor
you have
with
you

he denied
And
after
a little
again
those

the
man

whom
you speak of
But
he began
to curse
and
to swear

Not

And
Peter

word
that
had said
to him

She came beforehand
to anoint
the
body
of Me
for
Truly

and
all
the
Council
having bound

Jesus
early
they led [Him] away
and
delivered [Him]
to Pilate

the
chief priests

for
that
because of
envy
had delivered up
Him
the
chief priests

Barabbas

to them
But
the chief priests
stirred up
the
crowd
so that
instead
-
-
I should do
to Him
you call
the
King
of the
Jews
And
Pilate
again
answering
was saying
to them
What
then
-
And
again
they cried out
Crucify
Him

-
But
much more
they shouted
Crucify
Him
And
Pilate
was saying
to them
What
indeed
did He commit
evil

him
into
the
palace

And
a crown
they put on
Him

and
placed on
Him
having twisted together
of thorns
and
they began
to salute
Him

King
of the
Jews
And
and
bending
the
knees
they were kneeling down
to Him

a prominent
Council member
who
also

the
centurion
he questioned
him
whether
already
He had died

Pilate
wondered
if

He were dead
And
having called to [him]
And
to Joseph
having known [it]
from
the
centurion
He granted
the
body

And
laid
Him
in
a tomb

They say
to Him
Twelve

five

I broke
for
the
five thousand
how many
I am moved with compassion
with Me
and
nothing

that
they might eat
upon

because
already

three
they continue
When

took you up
And
said
Seven
the
seven
to
the
four thousand
of how many

And
He was saying
to them
Not yet

And
implore
Him
that
him
He might touch

Bethsaida
And
they bring
to Him
a blind [man]
and
And

having spit
upon

of him
having laid
the
having taken hold of
hands
upon him
He was asking
him
if
anything
you see
the
hand
of the
blind [man]
He led forth
him
out
And
I see [them]
walking
having looked up
he was saying
I see
the
men
for
as
trees
Then
and
he opened his eyes
and
he was restored
and
he began to see
clearly
everything
again
He laid
the
hands
upon
the
eyes
of him
And
the
village
may you enter
He sent
him
to
[the] home
of him
saying
Not
into
And
the
villages
of Caesarea
-
Philippi
And
on
the
way
He was questioning
went forth
the
disciples
of Him
saying
to them
Whom
Me
do pronounce
-
men
-
to be
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
into
-
and
others
Elijah
others
now
-
one
of the
prophets
And
they answered
Him
saying

John
the
Baptist
And
to be
Answering

Peter
says
to Him
You
are
the
Christ
He
was questioning
them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
And
on
the
way
For
some
of them
from
afar
are come
if
I shall send away
them
hungry
to
[the] homes
of them
they will faint
And
He warned
them
that
no one
they should tell
concerning
Him
And
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
the
He began
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
to be killed
and
after
three
days
to teach

them
that
it is necessary for
the
Son
-
And
to him
he began
to rebuke
Him
openly
the
word
He was speaking
And
having taken Him
-
Peter
-
Peter
and
said
Get
behind
Me
Satan
for
not
you have in mind
And
the
things
of God
but
the
things
of men
having turned
and
having looked upon
the
disciples
of Him
He rebuked
And
to them
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
having called to [Him]
let him take up
the
cross
of him
and
let him follow
Me
the
crowd
with
the
disciples
of Him
He said
Whoever
it
whoever
now
-
will lose
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
for
and
of the
gospel
he will save
it
if
might desire
-
life
his
to save
will lose
What
to lose
the
soul
of him
for
does it profit
a man
to gain
the
world
whole
and
What
for
shall give
a man
[as] an exchange
for the
soul
of him
Whoever
in
the
generation
this
-
adulterous
and
sinful
also
the
for
Son
-
of Man
will be ashamed of
him
when
He shall come
in
the
glory
if
of the
Father
of Him
with
the
angels
-
holy
may be ashamed of
Me
and
-
My
words
And
will be able
anyone
here
to satisfy
with bread
in
this desolate place
answered
Him
the
disciples
of Him
-
From where
these
And
Seven
He was asking
them
How many
have you
loaves
-
And
they said
And
having taken
the
seven
loaves
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
kept giving [them]
to
disciples
He directs
of Him
that
they might set before [them]
And
they set [it] before
the
crowd
the
crowd
to recline
on
the
ground
And
And
these
to be set before [them]
they had
small fish
a few
And
having blessed
them
He ordered
also
And
baskets
they ate
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
over and above
of fragments
seven
There were
now
about
four thousand
And
He sent away
them
And
here
of those
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
He was saying
they see
the
kingdom
-
of God
having come
with
power
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
there are
some
And
-
out from
the dead
to rise
that
saying
they kept
among
themselves
questioning
what
it is
And
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
they were asking
Him
saying
-
Say
the
scribes
that
-
all things
and
how
has it been written
of
the
Son
-
of Man
that
And
many things
He should suffer
and
be set at naught
He was saying
to them
Elijah
indeed
having come
first
restores
But
to him
whatever
they desired
as
it has been written
of
him
I say
to you
that
also
Elijah
has come
and
they did
And
them
and
scribes
arguing
with
them
having come
to
the
disciples
they saw
a crowd
great
around
And
running to [Him]
were greeting
Him
immediately
all
the
crowd
having seen
Him
were greatly amazed
and
And
He asked
them
What
are you disputing
with
them
And
the
son
of me
to
You
having
a spirit
mute
answered
Him
one
out of
the
crowd
Teacher
I brought

and
gnashes

And
I spoke
to the
disciples
whenever

they might cast out
and
not
they had power
if
him
it seizes
it throws down
him
and
he foams

Until
when

From

He asked
the

of him
How long

He rebuked

many
to say
that
he was dead
having cried out
and
much
having thrown him into convulsions
it came out
and
he became
as if

and
he arose
And
Jesus

by the

him
raised up

Him
Why

He
into

there
he wasted

prodigally
not
many
days
having gathered together
all
the

Having spent

that
and
he
began

of him
all
there arose
a famine

throughout

and
he sent
him
into

having gone
he joined himself
to one
of the
citizens
the

of that
And
that
were eating
the
pigs
and
no one
was giving
to him
he was longing
to fill
the
belly
of him
from
the
pods
To
of me
have abundance
of bread
I
however
with hunger
here
am perishing
himself
however
having come
he was saying
How many
hired servants
of the

Having risen up
Father
I have sinned
against

heaven

I will go
to
the

-
This [man]
sinners

were grumbling
the
both
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
saying
And
he
far
being distant
saw
him
the
father
of him
and
was moved with compassion
having risen up
and
having run
fell
upon
the
neck
of him
and
kissed
him
he went
to
the

of himself

now

for

dancing
now

of him
the

in
[the] field
And
these things
having called near
one
of the
servants
he began inquiring
what

might be

and
has killed
the

of you
the
calf

fattened
because
And
in good health
him
he has received
he said
to him
-
The

of you
is come
He was angry
of him
having gone
was begging
him
however
and
not
was willing
to go in
-
And
the father
-
I serve
you
and
never
a commandment
of you
I disobeyed
and
to me
never
And
did you give
a young goat
that
with
the
friends
of me
I might make merry
answering
he said
to
[the] father
Behold
so many
years
He spoke
then
to
them
the
parable
this
saying
When

living
with

came

for him

he said
to him
Son
you
always
with
me
To make merry
this
dead
was
and
is alive again
and
he was lost
and
is found
however
and
to rejoice
it was fitting
because
the
brother
of you
What
of
them
one
not
leaves
the
ninety
nine

and
goes
after
the [one]
having been lost
until
he finds
it
of
you
having
a hundred
sheep
and
having lost
And
having found [it]
he lays [it]
on
the
shoulders
of him
rejoicing
And
the
neighbors
saying
to them
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
the
sheep
having come
of me
the [one]
having been lost
to
the
house
he calls together
the
friends
and
I say
over
one
sinner
repenting
rather than
over
ninety
nine
righteous ones

to you
no
need
have
of repentance

coming
were licking

from

to

he said
No

they hear
not even
if
one
out from

will they be persuaded
however
to him
If
Moses

not
I know
they might receive
me
into
the
homes
of them
what
I will do
so that
when
I shall have been removed
from

he was saying
to the
first
How much

to

of me
having called to [him]

of the

was passing
through
[the] midst
of Samaria
and
Galilee
it came to pass
in
the
going up
to
Jerusalem
that
He
And
men
who
stood
afar off
on entering
of Him
into
a certain
village
met
ten
leprous
And
they
lifted up
[their] voice
saying
Jesus
Master
have compassion on
us
And
And
it came to pass
in
the
going
them
they were cleansed
having seen [them]
He said
to them
Having gone
show
yourselves
to the
priests
One
a voice
loud
glorifying

God
then
of
them
having seen
that
he was healed
turned back
with

to Him
and
he
was
a Samaritan
he fell
on
[his] face
at
the
feet
of Him
giving thanks
Having answered

said

were cleansed
None

to him
Having risen up
go forth

It is better
of him

he is thrown
into

he should cause to stumble

of these

of a mill

of God

them
and
said

of God

careful observation
by
the
Pharisees

of Man
to see

not
then
you will see [it]
to
the
disciples
Will come
days
when
you will desire
And
nor
follow
they will say
to you
Behold
there

here
Not
go forth
As

to
the [other end]
of the

shines

of Man
in
the

of Him
the
lightning
flashing
from
the [one end]
of
the
First
the

this
however
it behooves
Him
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
And
also
in
the
days
of the
Son
of
man
as
it came to pass
in
the
days
of Noah
thus
will it be
They were eating
into
the
ark
and
came
the
flood
and
destroyed
all
they were drinking
they were marrying
they were being given in marriage
until
that
day
entered
Noah
Likewise
they were buying
they were selling
they were planting
they were building
as
it came to pass
in
the
days
of Lot
they were eating
they were drinking
in that
and
brimstone
from
heaven
and
destroyed
all
then

went out
Lot
from
Sodom
it rained
fire
Take heed
and
if
he should repent
forgive
him
to yourselves
If
should sin
the
brother
of you
rebuke
him
According
of Man
is revealed
-
to these
will it be
in that
day
the
Son
-
In
and
the
goods
of him
in
the
house
not
let him come down
to take away
that
them
and
the [one]
in

likewise
not
let him return
to
the things

behind

the [one who]
will be

saying
Teacher
we know
that
rightly
You speak
Is it lawful

Having perceived
however
of them
the

He said
to

and
having marveled
at
the
answer
of Him
they became silent
not
they were able
to catch Him in
His
word
before
the
people
Having approached
there is
they questioned
Him
then
some
of the
Sadducees
the ones
denying
a resurrection
not

childless
is
that
should take
the

Teacher
of him
the

and
should raise up

wrote
to us
if
anyone’s
brother
should die
Seven

childless
therefore
brothers
there were
and
the
first
having taken
a wife
Answering
and
you tell
Me
now
He said
to
them

you
I also
one thing
and

Answering
now
some
of the
scribes
said
Teacher
well
you have spoken
The
baptism
of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men
No longer
then
did they dare
to ask
Him
anything
He said
of David

then
to
them
How
do they declare
the
Christ
to be
Himself

Lord
of me

of Me
for

in
[the] book
of Psalms

[the] Lord
until

David
is He
therefore
Him
Lord
calls
and
how
of him
son
Were listening
now
all
the
people
He said
to the
disciples
Beware
and
loving
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
first seats
in
the
of
synagogues
and
first places
in
the
banquets
the
scribes
-
desiring
to walk
in
long robes
who
pray
These
will receive
more abundant
condemnation
devour
the
houses
of
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
-
From
heaven
He will say
Because of
why
not
did you believe
him
And
they reasoned
among
themselves
saying
-
If
we should say
If
us
having been persuaded
for
they are
John
a prophet
to be
however
we should say
From
men
the
people
all
will stone
And
they answered
not
they knew
from where
And
by
what
authority
these things
I am doing
-
Jesus
said
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
He began
A man
planted
a vineyard
and
rented
it
to farmers
and
went abroad
a time
then
long
to
the
people
to speak
the
parable
this
Having looked up
gifts
of them
rich
now
He saw
the ones
casting
into
the
treasury
the
Then
against
kingdom
He was saying
to them
Will rise up
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
Earthquakes
there will be
fearful sights
also
and
from
heaven
signs
great
will there be
both
great
and
in different
places
famines
and
pestilences
Before
of them
and
will persecute [you]
delivering [you]
to
the
synagogues
and
prisons
bringing [you]
however
before
kings
and
governors
on account of
the
name
of Me
these things
all
they will lay
upon
you
the
hands
It will result
to you
for
a testimony
Settle
therefore
in
the
minds
of you
not
to premeditate
to make a defense
I
will be able
to resist
nor
to reply to
all
those
opposing
you
for
will give
you
a mouth
and
wisdom
which
not
You will be betrayed
and
friends
and
they will put to death
[some] from among
you
then
even
by
parents
and
brothers
and
relatives
And
you will be
hated
by
all
because of
the
name
of Me
But
a hair
of
the
head
of you
no
not
should perish
By
the
patient endurance
of you
you will gain
the
souls
of you
He saw
then
a certain

Judea

will be led captive
into

trees
He spoke
a parable
to them
Behold

fig tree
and
all
And

poor
more
than all

to you
that

I say
to you
that

and
those that
not

I will set off

now
the

we have received

also
we are rejoicing
in

Because of
the

and
through

sin

also
this
thus
to
all

from

even
But
If
for
by the

the

how much
[is] not
more
the

of God
and
the
gift
in

like
which [is]
of the
one
man
Jesus
Christ
to
the
many
did abound
the
trespass
so
also
the
gift
And
truly
for
judgment [was]
of
one
[was] unto
condemnation

but
the gift
[is] not
[is] out of

Christ
of the

-
death
reigned
So
[it is] unto
condemnation
so
also
by
one
act of righteousness
to
all
men
then
[it is] unto
justification
of life
just as
by
one
trespass
to
all
men
For as
were made
the
many
so
also
through
the
obedience
of the
One
for
righteous
will be made
the
many
through
the
disobedience
of the

sinners
through
the

this
in
which
we stand
and
we boast
in

of the

of God
also

access
we have
by the
faith
into
[The] law
abounded

overabounded

now
entered
so that
might abound
the
trespass
where
however
so that
also
-
grace
might reign
through
righteousness
unto
life
eternal
through
just as
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
reigned
the
sin
in

death
so
Not
knowing
that
-
tribulation
perseverance
produces
only [so]
now
but
also
we glory
in

tribulations
-
And
perseverance
character
-
and
character
hope

of God
has been poured out
into
the
hearts
of us
through
[the] Spirit
Holy
the [One]
And
having been given
to us
hope
not
does make [us] ashamed
because
the
love
-
Yet
for
[the] ungodly
died
indeed
Christ
being
of us
without strength
still
according to
[the] right time
Rarely
good [man]
perhaps
someone
even
would dare
to die
indeed
for
a righteous [man]
anyone
will die

the
Demonstrates
that

sinners
being

Christ
for
us
died
however
the

God
Much
we will be saved
by
Him
from
the
wrath
therefore
more
having been justified
now
by
the
blood
of Him
What
may abound
then
will we say
Shall we continue

in sin
that

grace
That which
He lives
He lives

to God
for
He died
-
to sin
He died
once for all
that which

Neither

Not

you are
to him whom
you obey

you yield

Thanks [be]
you have become obedient
now
from [the]

to

you were handed over
to the form

to God
that
you used to be

of sin
Having been set free
now
from

sin
you have become slaves

In human terms
for
you yielded

of you
For as
Never

When

Now

you have
the

To those

under

under
I became
[the] law
so that
those
under
[the] law
I might win

My
defense
to those
me
examining
is
this
No
not
have we
[the] right
to eat
and
to drink
No
the
other
apostles
and
the
brothers
of the
Lord
and
Cephas
not
have we
authority
a sister
a wife
to take about
as
also
Or
to work
only
I
and
Barnabas
not
have we
authority
not
Who
the
fruit
of it
not
does eat
Or
who
shepherds
a flock
and
serves as a soldier
from
the
milk
of the
flock
not
does drink
at his own
expense
at any time
Who
plants
a vineyard
and
Not
these things
not
says
according to
man
these things
do I speak
Or
also
the
law
In
treading out grain
Not
for the
oxen
is there care
-
with God
for
the
of Moses
law
it has been written
Not
you shall muzzle
an ox
Myself
and
gentleness
-
of Christ
who
as to
appearance
indeed
[am] humble
among
now
you
being absent
however
am bold
toward
you
I
Paul
exhort
you
by
the
meekness
For
but
the presence
of the
body
weak
and
the
speech
having been ignored
the
letters
indeed
they say
[are] weighty
and
strong
-
This
by
letters
being absent
such [we are]
also
being present
-
in action
let reckon
-
such a one
that
such as
we are
-
in word
Not
themselves
commending
but
these
by
themselves
themselves
measuring
and
comparing
for
themselves
with themselves
not
understand
dare we
to classify
or
to compare
ourselves [with]
some
-
We
the
measure
of the
area
that
has assigned
to us
-
God
a measure
however
to reach
as far as
also
you
not
into
the things
beyond measure
will boast
but
according to
Not
as far as
for
also
you
we came
in
the
gospel
-
of Christ
for
as
not
reaching
to
you
we are overextending
ourselves
not
however
having
increasing
the
faith
of you
among
you
to be enlarged
according to
to
the
area
of us
to
abundance
the things
beyond measure
boasting
in
others’
labors
hope
so as
in
things
ready
to boast
that
beyond
you
to preach the gospel
not
in
another’s
area
The [one]
however
boasting
in
[the] Lord
let him boast
Not
the one whom
the
Lord
commends
for
the [one]
himself
commending
this [one]
is
approved
but
I implore [you]
I reckon
to be daring
toward
some
-
reckoning
us
as
according to
flesh
now
walking
that
not
being present
to be bold
with the
confidence
with which
In
flesh
for
walking
not
according to
flesh
do we wage war
The
powerful
-
divinely
to
[the] demolition
of strongholds
arguments
overthrowing
for
weapons
of the
warfare
of us
[are] not
fleshly
but
and
and
taking captive
every
thought
into
the
obedience
-
of Christ
every
high thing
lifting itself up
against
the
knowledge
-
of God
and
your
-
obedience
in
readiness
having
to avenge
all
disobedience
when
might have been fulfilled
The things
to be
this
let him reckon
again
within
himself
that
as
he
[is] of Christ
according to
so
also [are]
we
appearance
are you looking
If
anyone
is persuaded
in himself
of Christ
If
of us
which
has given [us]
the
Lord
for
building [you] up
and
not
for
even
tearing down
you
not
I will be ashamed
for
more abundantly
somewhat
I should boast
concerning
the
authority
that
letters
not
[I] might seem
as if
-
to frighten
you
by means of
the
I wish
me
you were bearing with
me
little
a

but
indeed
you do bear with
Is

of Achaia
[the] truth
of Christ
in
me
that
the

this
Because of
why
Because
not
I do love
you
-
God
knows [I do]
What
of those
desiring
an opportunity
that
in
what
they are boasting
they might be found
as
also
however
we
I do
also
I will do
so that
I might cut off
the
opportunity
-
of Christ
For
such [are]
false apostles
workers
deceitful
disguising themselves
as
apostles
And
an angel
of light
no
wonder
himself
for
-
Satan
masquerades
as
[It is] not
as
servants
of righteousness
whose
-
end
will be
according to
the
deeds
surprising
of them
therefore
if
also
the
servants
of him
masquerade
Again
however
otherwise
even
as
a fool
receive
me
that
I also
little
I say
a
may boast
no
one
me
should think
a fool
to be
if
What
foolishness
in
this
the
confidence
-
of boasting
I am saying
not
according to
[the] Lord
am I saying
but
as
in
Since
many
boast
according to
the
flesh
I also
will boast
Gladly
for
you bear with
-
fools
wise
being
I am jealous as to
husband
a virgin
pure
to present
-
to Christ
for
you
of God
with [the] jealousy
I have betrothed
for
you
to one
You bear [it]
if
anyone
takes [from you]
if
anyone
exalts himself
if
anyone
in
[the] face
for
of you
strikes [you]
if
anyone
you
enslaves
if
anyone
devours [you]
As to
however
-
anyone
might be daring
in
foolishness
I speak
am daring
I also
dishonor
I speak
as
that
we
have been weak
In
whatever
Hebrews

I also
Descendants
of Abraham
are they
Servants

in
imprisonments
more abundantly
in

in

of Christ
are they
As being beside myself
I speak
above [measure]
I [too]
in
labors
From
[the] Jews
five times
forty [lashes]
minus
one
I received
Three times

I have passed
I was beaten with rods
once
I was stoned
three times
I was shipwrecked
a night and a day
in
the
in journeyings
in perils
from
[the] Gentiles
in perils
in
[the] city
in perils
in
[the] wilderness
in perils
often
on
[the] sea
in perils
among
false brothers
in perils
of rivers
in perils
of robbers
in perils
from [my own]
race
in labor
thirst
in
fastings
often
in
cold
and
nakedness
and
toil
in
watchings
often
in
hunger
and
Besides
[is my]
care
for all
the
churches
the things
external
the
pressure
on me
-
on every
day
Who
I
do burn inwardly
is weak
and
not
I am weak
Who
is led into sin
and
not
I am afraid
in
the
craftiness
of him
might be corrupted
the
minds
of you
from
the
however
simplicity
and
the
purity
-
in
Christ
lest
by any means
as
the
serpent
deceived
Eve
If
to boast
it behooves [me]
[in] the things
of the
weakness
of me
I will boast
The

I am lying

If

different
which
not
you did accept
well
are you bearing with [it]
for

another
Jesus
proclaims
whom
I reckon
for
in nothing
to have been inferior
to those
most eminent
apostles
If
in knowledge
but
in
every [way]
we have been made manifest
in
all things
to
you
however
even
unpolished
-
in speech [I am]
yet
not

Or
freely
the

of God

I preached
to you
a sin
did I commit
myself

so that
you
might be exalted
because
Other

I robbed

support
for
the

service
And
-
for
the need
of me
completely filled up
the
brothers
having come
from
Macedonia
being present

in
everything
unburdensome
myself
to you
I kept
and
will keep
with
you
and
having been in need
not
I did burden
no one
To boast
and
revelations
of [the] Lord
it behooves [me]
not
is it profitable
indeed
I will go on
however
to
visions
Therefore
persecutions
and
difficulties
for
Christ
when
for
I might be weak
then
strong
I take pleasure
I am
in
weaknesses
in
insults
in
hardships
in

you
to have been commended
In no way
for
was I inferior
to those
most eminent

that
myself
I
not

you
Forgive
me
for
the
wrong
this
is it
that
you were inferior
beyond
the

[of the] churches
Behold

not

Therefore

I hope
now
also
in

to have been made manifest
therefore
the

we persuade
to God
Not
of boasting
on behalf of

so that
you may have [an answer]
toward
those
in

boasting
again
and
not
in
[the] heart
ourselves
are we commending
to you

occasion
are giving
to you
If
for
we are beside ourselves
[it is] to God
or if
we are sober-minded
[it is] for you
The
that
One
for
all
has died
therefore

all
have died
for

of Christ
compels
us

this
And
should live

to the [One]
for

having died
and
having been raised again
for
all
He died
that
those
living
no longer

Therefore
Though
even
we have regarded
according to
flesh
Christ
yet
now
no longer
we regard [Him thus]
we
from

now
no one
regard
according to
[the] flesh
Therefore
have passed away
behold
has come into being
[the] new
if
anyone
[is] in
Christ
[he is] a new
creation
The

And
all things
[are] of

[This is] a plain token
you
of the

of God
for

also
you suffer
of the

to be accounted worthy
For indeed
righteous [it is]
with
God
to repay

from

in

of wickedness
unto those
perishing
in return for
which
And
for
-
to believe
them
what
[is] false
because of
this
will send
to them
-
God
a working
of delusion
in order that
having delighted
-
in unrighteousness
should be judged
all
those
not
having believed
the

but
We
brothers
beloved
by
[the] Lord
that
has chosen
you
-
God
from
however
[the] beginning
unto
salvation
in
[the] sanctification
of [the] Spirit
and
[by] faith
of [the] truth
ought
to give thanks
-
to God
always
concerning
you
to
to
[the] obtaining
of [the] glory
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
this
also
He called
you
through
the
gospel
of us
So
you were taught
whether
by
word
or
by
letter
from us
then
brothers
stand firm
and
hold fast
to the
traditions
that
Himself
God
the
Father
of us
the [One]
having loved
us
and
having given [us]
comfort
now

may He encourage

may He strengthen [them]
in

nor
to be troubled
neither
by

as if
by
us
as
that
is present
the
day
of the
not
Lord
quickly
to be shaken
you
in

mind
No
not [until]
shall have come
the
apostasy
first
and
shall have been revealed
the
man
-
one
of lawlessness
the
son
-
of destruction
you
should deceive
in
not one
way
because [it is]
if
the [one]
object of worship
so as for
him
in
the
temple
-
of God
to sit down
setting forth
opposing
he himself
that
is
God
and
exalting himself
above
every
so-called
god
or
Not
to you
do you remember
that
yet
being
with
you
these things
I was saying
And
in

his
time
now
that which
is restraining
you know
for
-
to be revealed
him
The
restraining [it]
at present
until
out of
[the] midst
he might be [gone]
for
mystery
already
is working
-
of lawlessness
only [there is]
the [one]
And
will slay
with the
breath
of the
mouth
of Him
and
will annul
by the
appearing
then
of the
coming
of Him
will be revealed
the
lawless [one]
whom
the
Lord
Jesus
whose
every
power
and
in signs
and
in wonders
of falsehood
is
-
coming
according to
[the] working
-
of Satan
in
-
of the
Lord
may spread quickly
and
may be glorified
just as
also
with
you
Finally
pray
brothers
for
us
that
the
word
Even
that
if
anyone
not
is willing
to work
neither
let him eat
for
when
we were

they may eat

such
we warn
and
exhort
by
our Lord
Jesus
You
now
brothers
not
shall grow weary
[in] well-doing
If
the

of this [man]
take note
not
to mix with
him
so that
he may be ashamed
then
anyone
not
obey
this
instruction
of us
through
And yet
not
