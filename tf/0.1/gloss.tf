7220	Jude
of Jesus
Christ
servant
then
brother
of James
To those
in
God
[the] Father
having been loved
and
in Jesus
Christ
having been kept
called
to you
Mercy
and
peace
and
love
be multiplied
Beloved
all
diligence
using
to write
to you
concerning
-
common
of us
salvation
necessity
I had
to write
to you
exhorting [you]
to contend earnestly
for the
once for all
having been delivered
to the
saints
faith
for
Came in stealthily
certain
men
those
long ago
having been designated
unto
this
-
condemnation
ungodly [ones]
the
of the
God
of us
grace
changing
into
sensuality
and
the
only
master
and
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
denying
now
I want
having known
at one time
all this
To remind
you
that
Jesus
a people
out of
[the] land
of Egypt
having saved
-
afterward
those
not
having believed
He destroyed
both
[The] angels
-
not
having kept
[own]
their
domain
but
having left
the
own
dwelling
unto
[the] judgment
of [the] great
day
in chains
eternal
under
darkness
He keeps
just as
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
the
around
them
cities
-
in like
manner
with them
having indulged in sexual immorality
and
having gone
after
flesh
strange
are set forth as
an example
of fire
eternal
[the] penalty
undergoing
yet
Likewise
also
these
dreaming [ones]
indeed
[the] flesh
defile
then
authority
set aside
and
glorious [ones]
blaspheme
But
when
with the
devil
disputing
he was reasoning
about
-
Mosesâ€™
body
not
-
Michael
the
archangel
did dare
a judgment
blasphemous
to bring against [him]
but
said
Rebuke
you
[the] Lord
however
indeed
These
whatever things
not
they have seen
they speak evil of
then
whatever things
naturally
as
the
irrational
animals
they understand
in
these things
they corrupt themselves
Woe
to them
because
in the
way
-
of Cain
they went
and
to the
error
-
of Balaam
for reward
they rushed
and
in the
rebellion
-
of Korah
they perished
These
are
the ones
in
the
love feasts
of you
hidden reefs
feasting together [with you]
fearlessly
themselves
shepherding
clouds
without water
by
winds
being carried about
trees
autumnal
without fruit
twice
having died
having been uprooted
waves
wild
of [the] sea
foaming out
-
of their
shame
stars
wandering
to whom
the
gloom
-
of darkness
to
[the] age
has been reserved
then
Prophesied
also
as to these
[the] seventh
from
Adam
Enoch
saying
Behold
has come
[the] Lord
amidst
holy [ones]
myriads
of His
to execute
judgment
against
all
and
to convict
all
the
ungodly
concerning
all
the
works
of ungodliness
of them
which
they have done in an ungodly way
and
concerning
all
the
harsh [things]
that
have spoken
against
Him
sinners
ungodly
These
are
grumblers
discontented
after
the
lusts
own
following
and
the
mouth
of them
speaks
great swelling [words]
flattering
faces
profit
for the sake of
however
beloved
You
remember
the
words
-
having been spoken beforehand
by
the
apostles
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
they were saying
to you
In
[the] last
-
time
there will be
scoffers
following
after
-
their own
passions
-
of ungodlinesses
These
are
those
causing divisions
worldly-minded
[the] Spirit
not
having
however
beloved
You
building up
yourselves
in the
most holy
of you
faith
in
[the] Spirit
Holy
praying
yourselves
in
[the] love
of God
keep
awaiting
the
mercy
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
unto
life
eternal
And
indeed
those who
are doubting
have mercy on
save
out of
[the] fire
snatching
then
to others
show mercy
with
fear
hating
even
the
by
the
flesh
having been stained
clothing
now
To Him
being able
to keep
you
from stumbling
and
to present [you]
in the presence of
the
glory
of Him
blameless
with
exultation
to [the] only
God
Savior
of us
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
[be] glory
majesty

and

before
all

all
the
ages
Amen
