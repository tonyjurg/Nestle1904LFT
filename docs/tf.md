# About Text-Fabric

Text-Fabric is a Python based software package developed by [Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda) and is available at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric). It allows both programmers and non-programmers to access and utilize a vast collection of ancient texts and linguistic annotations. It treats these texts and annotations as data, similar to tables, while preserving the structure of the original text.
