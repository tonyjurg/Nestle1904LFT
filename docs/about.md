# About this dataset

This repository belongs to a set of repositorie dedicated to storing the code and data generated for the 'Nestle 1904 Text-Fabric conversion project', a collaboration between [ETCBC](https://github.com/ETCBC) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) and [CBLC](https://github.com/CenterBLC) (Andrews University). 

The project comprises various TextFabric presentations of the Nestle 1904 version of the Greek New Testament, including:
* [https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904GBI](https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904GBI)
* [https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904LFT](https://github.com/tonyjurg/Nestle1904LFT)
* [https://github.com/saulocantanhede/tfgreek2](https://github.com/saulocantanhede/tfgreek2)

Each version uses a different conversion method, resulting in a distinct set of features. The final stable product is planned to be stored at:
* [https://github.com/ETCBC/nestle1904](https://github.com/ETCBC/nestle1904)

# Differences between datasets

The Text-Fabric datasets vary in terms of the included syntactical information, which is evident when comparing their presentation of text, grammar, and syntax. Below are two images depicting the graphical representation of John 1:1.
